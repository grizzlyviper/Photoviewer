# Photoviewer

This represents the front end of the mountain cam app, showing scraped photos from the S3 bucket populated by the backend.

Vanilla JS with a hash router and fslightbox for photo viewing. No build other than running a static file server, e.g. running `python3 -m http.server` in this directory and navigating to <http://localhost:8000>, or running a dev server on VSCode.
